## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Uniarts is a substrate based blockchain network for NFT creation, auction and circulation. With its own industry level NFT creation tool and cross-chain solution, Uniarts aim to become the major gateway between business, individual or even A.I creators and blockchain networks, hence bring their unique artworks into an united NFT platform.

NFT Authoring SDK is a set of plug-in tools for mainstream editor software, such as Photoshop, Cubism Editor, and Final Cut Pro. It can transfer pictures, videos & audios or even animated Interactive 2D illustrations & 3D models into NFTs and publish it on the Uniarts network directly from editor software. NFT Authoring tool for Photoshop is one of the plug-ins of Uniarts NFT Authoring SDK.

### Overview

* Wallet management for substrate based network: generation, import, export
* NFT data attribute editing
* NFT publish support for substrate based network with evm compatibility

### Project Details

#### Authoring Tool NFT SDK(For Photoshop)

Develop based on Adobe UXP SDK and UXP API, and plan to release this plugin directly on Adobe market. 

The Adobe UXP Developer Tool allows user to manage and create plug-in for Photoshop and other UXP-powered host applications. Since Photoship is mainstream editor, this plug-in will bring creators closer to NFT and substrate based networks. Uniarts team plan to develop and release plug-ins for Cubism Editor, Final Cut Pro, and Unity 3D.
